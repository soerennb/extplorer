This package was debianized by Thomas Goirand <thomas@goirand.fr> on
Wed, 07 Oct 2009 10:45:22 +0800

It was downloaded from:
http://extplorer.sourceforge.net/

Upstream Author:
	Soeren Eberhardt <soeren@virtuemart.net>

Other licenses:
	eXtplorer embeds loads of libraries in its original upstream source
	package. Some packages were even some PHP pear packages carying some
	licenses that are usable in Debian only for PHP itself. That means
	that, even if the license PHP 2.02 could work for a PEAR package in
	the Debian distribution, this couldn't even in the Debian source
	package of eXtplorer.
	For this reason, the maintainers of this package decided to create a
	+dfsg version of the upstream code deleting unwanted libraries. All
	the libraries that could be packaged separately, outside of
	eXtplorer have been totally removed using the available shell script
	debian/create_dfsg_from_upstream that is to be run right after
	extraction of the upstream binary.

	Here is a list of what has been removed from the upstream source,
	once scripts.tar.gz has been extracted, together with the
	corresponding Debian package:

	scripts/editarea:				libjs-edit-are
	scripts/extjs3:					libjs-extjs
	scripts/yui:					libjs-yui
	libraries/Auth, libraries/HTTP:			php-auth-http
	libraries/Console, libraries/PEAR.php, libraries/Tar.php
	libraries/System.php:				php-pear
	libraries/geshi:				php-geshi
	libraries/compat.php41x.php, libraries/compat.php42x.php
	libraries/compat.php50x.php:			php-compat
	libraries/JSON.php:				php-services-json
	libraries/MIME:					php-mime-type
	libraries/FTP.php, libraries/FTP:		php-net-ftp
